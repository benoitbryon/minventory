`minventory` provides RESTful IT management service.

Basically, it consists in:

* an API, i.e. a server-side application that holds data about machines and IP
  addresses;

* an UI, i.e. a client-side application that displays data using server's API.

`minventory` is at early prototype stage!

Primary goal is to meet expectations of project's initial users, so that they
can easily import existing data, review the advantages of a RESTful API, then
prioritize their needs before further development.
